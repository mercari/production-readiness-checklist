This article explains what is automatic build.

## What is Automatic build

We have already discussed how to simplify build commands in [Automated Build](automated-build.md).

Automatic build triggers the build process for your microservice automatically.
Usually the process is triggered when there are changes in application code or via a scheduler job.

## Why do we need Automatic build?

- Eliminate manual work to build the applications
- Every changes that we made is ready to deploy anytime
