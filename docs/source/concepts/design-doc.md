# Design Doc

All services should maintain a design doc. A design doc is created before starting work on a new service, and should be kept up-to-date with any changes made to the service design.

## Why is it Important?

- Helps communicate ideas
- Quick reference for anyone who needs to know about a service
- Helps to ensure an idea considers business requirements like dependencies, security etc.

## Tips and Tricks

Internally, we have a [Design Doc Template](../references/design-doc-template.md) for new services.
