# Automated build

This article introduces "Automated build".
You will understand what automated build steps are.

## What is "Automated build"

Automated build means that some resource can be built with one command.
When building from the CLI, it can be expressed as "it can be built with one command", but in more abstract terms, it means "making it easy to build".

Let me give concrete examples.

- Makefile
- Shell Script (Scripting build steps)
- etc...

## Why do we need "Automated build"?

Tedious or complex procedures should be simplified.
Steps that are executed many times should be simplified.
It is necessary to improve reproducibility.
