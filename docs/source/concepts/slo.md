# Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

> An SLO is a service level objective: a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI. [...] For example, we might decide that we will return Shakespeare search results "quickly," adopting an SLO that our average search request latency should be less than 100 milliseconds.

## Why is it Important?

- To set expectations within your team and other teams about how a service should perform
- To track and understand how well your service is performing
- To help balance feature development and reliability improvements
  - When you know you are not meeting your target performance / reliability, it's a reminder that you need to change focus from new features back to reliability improvements
