This guide explains what is gradual deployment.

## What is Gradual Deployment

Gradual deployment or rolling update is a deployment strategy to introduce new code into existing deployment, 
gradually increase the amount of new instance while reducing the old instance until all are replaced.

## Why do wee need Gradual Deployment

With gradual deployment we can reduce risk of exposing critical error to all users if there are unexpected 
issues with the new code.

Gradual deployment also can ensure we have zero downtime when deploying new code.
