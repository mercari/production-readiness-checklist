# Design Checklist

This checklist contains items are things that must be considered during the design phase and verified before the start of implementation.

## :sunny: General
The following items are general architectural checks which all microservices must meet.

| Check name | Short Description  | Level C | Level B | Level A |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| [Stateless server](../concepts/stateless-server.md) | All persistent data is stored outside of the container. | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| [Deploy order](../concepts/deploy-order.md) | Its deploy does not have strong order. |  | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| [Exclusive data ownership](../concepts/exclusive-data-ownership.md) | It is the only service that can access its data store. | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |

## :lock: Security
If security is low, customer and company data will be stolen or fabricated (Data breaches).

| Check name | Short Description  | Level C | Level B | Level A |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| Authentication | It is protected by an authentication service. | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| Authorization | Access is restricted to the appropriate level. Consider who should have access to each exposed API and what they are allowed to do.  | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| Transport Security | It uses TLS to communicate with other services over the Internet. | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |

## :four_leaf_clover: Sustainability
Sustainability affects long-term team/organization productivity and system availability. If sustainability is low, the system will break down often, maintainers will be changed too often. This will cause low availability. Also, the team members will be forced too much work, low-ownership. Then they will be burnout.

| Check name | Short Description  | Level C | Level B | Level A |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| No short-term transfer | Its team members are not forced to move to another team in the short term. |  | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| OnCall considered team | Its team follows OnCall practices. |  |  | :white_check_mark: |
| Dependency SLA | Its team knows SLA of the service dependencies. |  | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| [SLOs](../concepts/slo.md) | Its SLOs and SLOs owner are defined. |  | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
